# Python Docstrip

In the course of programming experiments, I implemented this `.ptx` file format to store Python scripts and documentations in one single text file, on the basis of `ctxdoc` class. The file can be executed with `xetex` to extract scripts, or `xelatex` to generate docs.

For the fonts used, you may need the `inriafonts`, `newcomputermodern`, `lexend` packages, along with Iosevka, Source Han Serif SC, Sarasa Gothic SC, and Sarasa Mono SC which are available from GitHub.
